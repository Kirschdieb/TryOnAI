# 🔧 Blob URL Issue Fix - Local Image Upload Problem

## 🐛 **Problem Identified**

When uploading local product images, users encountered this error:
```
GET blob:http://localhost:5173/10cfc2de-2a94-4ca1-b62d-f399b930b470 net::ERR_FILE_NOT_FOUND
```

## 🔍 **Root Cause**

The issue was that **blob URLs are temporary** and only exist during the current page session. When navigating from HomeUpload to TryOnStudio, the blob URLs were being revoked, causing the images to become unavailable.

### **The Problem Flow:**
1. User uploads local image → Creates blob URL
2. User clicks "Try On" → Navigates to studio
3. Blob URL gets revoked during navigation
4. Studio can't find the image → Error

## ✅ **Solution Implemented**

Converted all local image uploads to **base64 format** for persistent storage across page navigation.

### **Files Fixed:**

#### **1. HomeUpload.jsx**
- ✅ **Cloth Photo Upload**: Now converts to base64 instead of blob URL
- ✅ **User Photo Upload**: Now converts to base64 in `handleTryOn`
- ✅ **Preview Handling**: Updated to handle both File objects and base64 strings

#### **2. TryOnStudio.jsx**  
- ✅ **FormData Preparation**: Now converts base64 back to blob for API submission
- ✅ **Preview Display**: Already handled base64 strings correctly

### **Key Changes:**

```javascript
// BEFORE: Using blob URLs (temporary)
const previewUrl = URL.createObjectURL(clothPhotoFile);
setLocalClothPhotoUrl(previewUrl);

// AFTER: Using base64 (persistent)
const base64 = await convertFileToBase64(clothPhotoFile);
setLocalClothPhotoUrl(base64);
```

```javascript
// BEFORE: Passing File object (would become unavailable)
setUserPhoto(userPhotoFile);

// AFTER: Converting to base64 (persistent across navigation)
const userPhotoData = await convertFileToBase64(userPhotoFile);
setUserPhoto(userPhotoData);
```

## 🧪 **Testing Workflow**

1. **Upload Local Product Image**: Select a file from your computer ✅
2. **Upload User Photo**: Select your photo ✅  
3. **Click "Try On"**: Navigate to studio ✅
4. **Verify Images Display**: Both images should show correctly ✅
5. **Generate Try-On**: Should work without blob URL errors ✅

## 🎯 **Expected Results**

- ✅ **No More Blob Errors**: Images persist across page navigation
- ✅ **Consistent Experience**: Local uploads work same as URL uploads  
- ✅ **API Compatibility**: Base64 images converted back to blobs for server submission
- ✅ **Cross-Session Persistence**: Images survive browser refreshes

## 📋 **Technical Details**

- **Storage Format**: Base64 strings in Zustand store
- **Preview Display**: Direct base64 rendering  
- **API Submission**: Base64 → Blob conversion for FormData
- **Persistence**: Images survive navigation and browser refreshes
