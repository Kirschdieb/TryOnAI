# 🐛 Profile Logout Issue - Debugging Guide

## 🔍 **Root Cause Found & Fixed**

The issue was in the **image change handlers** using stale React state when saving to localStorage.

### **The Problem:**
```javascript
// ❌ WRONG (old code)
setProfile((prev) => ({ ...prev, imageUrl: base64 }));
const updatedProfile = { ...profile, imageUrl: base64 }; // Uses OLD state!
localStorage.setItem('userProfile', JSON.stringify(updatedProfile));
```

This would save corrupted/incomplete profile data to localStorage, causing the profile to appear invalid on next load.

### **The Solution:**
```javascript
// ✅ CORRECT (new code)
setProfile((prev) => {
  const updatedProfile = { ...prev, imageUrl: base64 };
  localStorage.setItem('userProfile', JSON.stringify(updatedProfile)); // Uses NEW state!
  return updatedProfile;
});
```

## 🔧 **What Was Fixed:**

1. **`handleImageChange`** - Profile picture uploads
2. **`handleTryonFrontImageChange`** - Front tryon photo uploads  
3. **`handleTryonBackImageChange`** - Back tryon photo uploads
4. **`handleChange`** - Text field changes (name, email, etc.)

## 🚨 **Additional Safeguards Added:**

1. **Error Handling**: localStorage operations now have try/catch
2. **Debug Logging**: Console logs to track what's happening
3. **Quota Protection**: Won't crash if localStorage is full

## 🧪 **Testing Steps:**

1. **Load Profile**: Import a ZIP backup → Should show logged in
2. **Generate Image**: Go to TryOn Studio → Create image → Save to album
3. **Return to Profile**: Go back to Profile page → Should STAY logged in
4. **Verify Data**: Check that albums show the new generated image
5. **Export Test**: Export as ZIP → Should include the new image

## 📊 **Debug Console Logs**

When testing, watch the browser console (F12) for these logs:
- `[Profile] Checking login status:` - Shows if login is detected
- `[Profile] Loaded profile: <name> ID: <id>` - Confirms profile load
- `[Profile] <field> updated and saved to localStorage` - Confirms saves
- `[Profile] Logout triggered` - Shows if logout is called unexpectedly

## 🎯 **Expected Behavior Now:**

1. ✅ Load profile from ZIP → Stays logged in
2. ✅ Generate images → Profile remains intact
3. ✅ Upload profile photos → No logout
4. ✅ Edit profile fields → No logout  
5. ✅ Return to profile page → Still logged in
6. ✅ Export includes all new content

## 🚀 **If Issue Persists:**

Check console for:
- `[Profile] Logout triggered` - Unexpected logout calls
- `localStorage quota exceeded` - Storage is full
- `Error parsing saved profile` - Corrupted data

The debug logs will help identify exactly what's causing any remaining logout issues.
